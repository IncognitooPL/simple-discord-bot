# Completely simple discord bot
Just like the name says, it's just an easy and simple Discord bot created for the needs of one server and learning the python language.
(Unfinished ofc.)

Ideas
-----

- Creating a web panel for managing the bot
- Addition of a system of advertisements
- Expansion of admin tools
- Welcome messages
- Maybe some "fun" functions
- Adding the possibility of creating embeds with a custom title, footer, photo etc.

To Do
-----

- Increase the ability to customize commands through the config
- Add descriptions, aliases, categories etc. to @bot.command(...)
- Add streaming to the change activity option
- Add more possible errors to on_command_error
- Add the ability to set permissions to each command separately

Installation
-----
Python 3.5.3 or higher is required

```
# Linux/macOS
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py==1.7.2 
python3 -m pip install -U discord-components==2.1.2

# Windows
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py==1.7.2
py -3 -m pip install -U discord-components==2.1.2

git clone https://github.com/IncognitooPL/simple-discord-bot
```

After full installation, set your bot token which you will generate at https://discord.com/developers/applications. 

Paste it in the appropriate place in the credentials.json file. Feel free to customize the config.json file.
